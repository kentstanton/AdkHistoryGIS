# AdkHistoryGIS
Assets and scripts supporting the creation of a Forest History Information System (a Geographic Information System: a GIS) for the Adirondack Mountain Region of New York State.

A forest history GIS is used to record and analyze the change history of a forested landscape.

The assets in this repository support the development of a GIS designed to manage structured data sets representing the state of a forest over time. The system uses a protocol based process to support the acquistion, management and storage of data in a way that maintains provenance and clarity on exactly what the various data represent.

The Adirondack Forest GIS represents a specific instance of a type of GIS. The intent is to support the creation of forest information systems representing other forests and other natural landscapes of ecological interest.
